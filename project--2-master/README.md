This project is to build out a Giphy search engine. The site will be responsive and will work well on both desktop and mobile devices

The user can submit a keyword, and will receive images displayed as a response. Custom CSS grid will be used to display the images.

Technologies used are: HTML, SCSS, CSS, JS/Jquery

Use bootstrap instead of all SCSS and CSS to simplify stying. Add information to the tabs in the navigation bar. Add an information tab/page to the site to make it more user friendly.
